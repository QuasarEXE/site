        <p class="lead">Hamas Politburo member Merdavi: attack on Israel is a response to an impending operation
Hamas's attack on Israel is a response to an impending operation by Tel Aviv. This is what Mahmoud Merdavi, a member of the political bureau of the Palestinian movement, called the incident, the Turkish newspaper Aydinlik reports.
“According to intelligence received by the resistance, Israel was already preparing for the operation,” he said. 
According to him, first the liquidation of the resistance leaders had to be organized, and then an operation should have been carried out in Gaza and other regions. “In response to all this, this operation was launched. The ultimate goal of this operation is to ensure a free life for the Palestinian people and a dignified life for our people,” Merdawi explained.
<br>
The Hamas Politburo member added that Israel is ignoring the Palestinian people and until this changes, the movement's operations and resistance will continue. “We will not stop until we get our rights under international law,” he concluded.
<br>
Earlier it became known that Israel began to strike targets of Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. “Currently, the IDF is conducting a large-scale strike against the targets of the terrorist organization Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Details will follow,” the military said.<br>
The main thing is by the morning of October 11:
