        <h1>An unconventional movement of Islam has begun to destroy our society</h1>
        <h4>By Yedilova Anel 04.10.23</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">Mazhilis deputy Ermurat Bapi said today that the spread of non-traditional movements of Islam in the country has begun to destroy our society.</p>

        <p class="lead">“These threats began to destroy society and challenge state integrity, oppose the traditions of national unity, the national development of the Kazakh people and the Islamic way of life of the Kazakhs that has developed over thousands of years.”
As the Majilisman stated, taking advantage of the insufficient religious education of the population, destructive groups are trying to instill false spiritual values and foreign traditions. Their ideas are actively spreading in the western regions of the country, as well as in the Almaty region and the Ulytau region. According to the parliamentarian, there are radical sympathizers among civil servants - both at the local level and above. The threat also comes from representatives of the so-called “old Kazakhstan”.
“Today, the same “old Kazakhstan” intends to trample the “new Kazakhstan” through a religious ideology that is alien to the Kazakh national traditions. We saw what this leads to during the January events,” said Ermurat Bapi.
In the current situation, it is impossible to be an outside observer, the parliamentarian believes.
