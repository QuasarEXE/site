        <h1>Why Tokayev brought back the celebration of Republic Day, according to political scientists.</h1>
        <h4>By Yedilova Anel 25.10.23</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">Kassym-Jomart Tokayev heard a report from the Minister of Justice Azamat Eskarayev on the results of the work of the justice authorities for nine months of this year and on plans for the coming period</p>

        <p class="lead">As you know, Republic Day again became an official holiday and day off in Kazakhstan only last year. For quite a long period, this important date in our modern history undeservedly fell out of the picture and was not celebrated in any way. <br>
 Why did Kassym-Jomart Tokayev resume the celebration of Republic Day? A tengrinews.kz correspondent asked this question to well-known Kazakh political scientists.
<br>
 Political scientist, Mazhilis deputy Aidos Sarym highlighted several points.
<br>
“The previous concept was still leader-centric, aimed at ensuring that all achievements of independence and the state were focused on a specific person. In the current concept, we understand that independence is not just when a certain day is appointed and the country celebrates it. This is the result the work of a huge number of people, including the previous Parliament, the Supreme Council, towards which the former elites and the former leader of the country did not have the kindest feelings,” Sarym said.

<br>
According to the recollections of the Majilisman, in the fall of 1990 passions were in full swing in the political space of the republic.
<br>
“I was a schoolboy then, we went to the building of the Supreme Council every day. Rallies did not stop near it, people demanded independence, there were always some debates in Parliament. In my opinion, the adoption of the Declaration of Sovereignty is the first step towards independence, on the one hand. On the other hand, we must not forget about the moral and political lessons and dilemmas that accompany our society. It so happens that December itself is tragic for Kazakhstan, and this is not the best time to celebrate. It is better to dedicate it to the memory of those people who achieved independence and fought for it. In addition, given the climate of our country, December is not very convenient for mass events. Therefore, I believe that by returning this holiday, the President made a Solomonic decision. On October 25, we celebrate those people who are now in our ranks, reward those who have distinguished themselves, and talk about their achievements. And December is a time when we are in a state of grateful memory regarding our history,” the political scientist believes.
<br>
Director of the Institute of Eurasian Integration Urazgali Selteev named two possible reasons why October 25 ceased to be a holiday.
<br>
“Firstly, such a step may be associated with the desire to neutralize the significance of the December events of 1986 and “close” this date only with Independence Day. Secondly, I assume that in 2009, someone imposed on Nazarbayev their subjective opinion about the priority of two historical events from an ideological point of view. Supposedly, the declaration of independence should be perceived as a finalized result, and the declaration of sovereignty only preceded it. However, the media then justified this as a duplication of two holidays associated with independence. I believe that in fact these are events of different significance; they should be separated from each other and both remain in the historical memory of the people,” Selteev said.
<br>
As the political scientist notes, on October 25, 1990, the Declaration of State Sovereignty was adopted, which has a decisive political significance for our country, since it first outlined the political and legal foundations of Kazakhstan as a sovereign state - unitarity, integrity, indivisibility, inviolability. It was on the basis of the principles of this document that the Constitutional Law “On State Independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan” was subsequently adopted. Therefore, both the priority of events in chronology and the historical priority of the declaration over the Constitutional Law are obvious here.
<br>
“As for December 16, this date is now rightly fixed as the day of remembrance of the heroes who took part in the December events of 1986. I think this is the logic of restoring historical justice, which Tokayev implemented last year by returning October 25 to the political calendar and defining the official interpretation public holiday on December 16,” concluded the director of the Institute of Eurasian Integration.
<br>
Let us recall that in September 2022, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed a law containing a rule defining October 25 as a national holiday - Republic Day. The initiative to return Republic Day to the status of a national holiday was announced by the Head of State at the first meeting of the National Kurultai in 2022. At the same time, the President recalled that on October 25, 1990, the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Kazakhstan was adopted.
